    This site was designed with the following principles and design patterns in mind:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Single Page Application (<a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/SPA' target='_blank'>SPA</a>)</b>
          <br>
          All the content on this page, with the exception of external links, are accessible on this single page.
          This removes the need to load new pages resulting in seamless tranitions.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Responsive Web Design</b>
          <br>
          The content is displayed in an appropriate manner for various displays and window sizes.
          The site layout has been designed for a comfortable viewing on both desktop and mobile devices.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Optimisation in relation to website size</b>
        <br>
        Keeping a good balance of maintainability and performance in relation to the sites content.
        The web has become more resource intensive and websites have gotten bigger resulting in longer load times.
        This is often unecessary and much of it stems from unnecessary code and dependencies.
        It is for this reason that I have decided to make this site static and avoided using JS frameworks as I believe it would be accessive for a site of this size.
      </li>
    </ul>
